OBJECTIVE

Build a mobile-first daily quiz / MCQ exam web application where:

No user can attempt a quiz without identification

Users never see ranks, scores, or leaderboards

Only the admin panel can view daily and competition results

Scoring follows a strict, deterministic marking scheme

Ranking is computed only for verified participants

Strong mobile lockdown behavior is enforced

The system must be suitable for serious competitive quizzes and mock exams, ensuring fair ranking, auditability, integrity, and anti-cheating enforcement.

1. USER IDENTIFICATION (MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS)
Entry Requirement

Before accessing any quiz:

User must either:

Enter their participant name (first time only), OR

Log in using authentication (username/password or OTP)

No question, timer, or fullscreen mode may start until identification is complete

First-Time User (Name-Based Flow)

Rules:

User enters full name

Validation:

Minimum 3 characters

Alphanumeric + spaces only

Once accepted:

Name is permanently bound to:

Device ID

Browser fingerprint

Same device must reuse the same name for all future quizzes

User cannot change name

Only admin can reset or reassign identity

Backend Enforcement

Each submission must include:

Participant Name OR User ID

Device ID

Question ID

Quiz Date

Submission Timestamp (millisecond precision)

If identity is missing or invalid:

Submission must be rejected

User must be blocked from quiz access

2. USER INTERFACE RULES (STRICT)

3. ADMIN PANEL (PASSWORD PROTECTED)

Admin capabilities:

4. DATA INPUTS (PER QUESTION — REQUIRED)

Each submission must store:

Unattempted

Answer Order

Integer starting from 1

Wrong Attempt Order

Integer starting from 1

Reset per participant per question

Previous Question Score

Numeric

Used for Extra Marks eligibility

All counters reset per question.

5. MARKING SCHEME (STRICT & DETERMINISTIC)
5.1 Base Marks (Correct Answers)
Base Marks = 510 − (Answer Order × 10)
If Base Marks < 0 → Base Marks = 0

5.2 Deduction Marks (Wrong Answers)
Deduction Marks = −5 × (Wrong Attempt Order − 1)


Examples:

1st wrong attempt → 0

2nd → −5

3rd → −10

5.3 Unattempted Rule
Score = 0

5.4 Extra Marks Eligibility

Extra marks apply to the next question only if:

Previous Question Score ≤ 0


Rules:

Eligibility does NOT stack

Cannot be used in consecutive questions

Resets after use

5.5 Extra Marks Bonus Percentage
Bonus Percentage = MAX(0, 0.7 − (Answer Order × 0.1))


Examples:

Order 1 → 60%

Order 2 → 50%

Order 3 → 40%

Order ≥7 → 0%

5.6 Extra Marks Calculation

If eligible AND answer is correct:

Score = Base Marks × (1 + Bonus Percentage)


Otherwise:

Score = Base Marks


After application:

Extra Marks Eligible = FALSE

5.7 Final Score Logic
IF Correct → Score = Extra Score
IF Wrong → Score = Deduction Marks
IF Unattempted → Score = 0

5.8 Score Floor Protection
If Score < −50 → Score = −50


Applied per question.

5.9 Total Score
Total Score = SUM(All Question Scores)


Computed server-side only.
